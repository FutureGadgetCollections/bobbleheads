      "Attended games for the experience, not the collectibles",
      "Accumulated items passively over multiple seasons as a season ticket holder",

    "strategicAdvantages": [
      "Bulk Purchase Leverage: Buying in bulk allowed for better negotiation on per-unit pricing",
      "Seller preferred single transaction over listing items individually",
      "Reduced the seller's time and effort compared to eBay/marketplace sales",
      "Information Asymmetry: Extensive pre-purchase research gave accurate market values",
      "Seller didn't invest time in researching individual item values",
      "Quality Assurance: All items new in box (NIB) - critical for collectible value",
      "Verified condition before purchase",
      "Season ticket holder storage ensured proper care",
      "No risk of counterfeit items from original recipient",
      "Portfolio Diversification: Acquired multiple years (2022-2024) in single transaction"

  "lessonsLearned": [
    "Season ticket holders are ideal sellers - They accumulate items naturally but often don't collect them",
    "Bulk purchases create negotiation leverage - Sellers value convenience of single transaction",
    "Research is critical - Knowing true market values enables confident negotiation",
    "NIB condition is non-negotiable - Condition dramatically affects collectible value",
    "80% of market is a strong entry point - Provides margin of safety and profit potential"
