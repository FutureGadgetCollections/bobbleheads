## Season Ticket Holder Buyout

### Overview

This purchase originated from a Facebook Marketplace post by a Detroit Lions season ticket holder who had accumulated various stadium giveaways and season ticket holder gifts over the years. All items were stored in a closet and remained new in box (NIB), as the seller was a fan who attended games for the experience rather than collecting promotional items.

**Purchase Date:** December 11, 2025
**Total Amount:** $250.00
**Source:** Facebook Marketplace
**Seller Profile:** Lions season ticket holder looking to liquidate giveaway items

## Phil's Thoughts

### First Bobblehead Purchase

This is my first bobblehead purchase. I'm really just testing the waters here to see if this could be a viable collectible investment category. The opportunity seemed solid based on my research, so I decided to take the plunge with a small-scale bulk purchase.

### Why This Purchase Works

This type of seller represents the ideal acquisition opportunity for building a bobblehead position. Here's why this purchase worked so well:

### Perfect Seller Profile

The seller was a genuine Lions fan who:
- Attended games for the experience, not the collectibles
- Accumulated items passively over multiple seasons as a season ticket holder
- Had no emotional attachment to the promotional items
- Simply wanted to clear closet space and liquidate quickly
- Wasn't a collector, so didn't know or care about maximizing value

### Strategic Advantages

**1. Bulk Purchase Leverage**
- Buying in bulk allowed for better negotiation on per-unit pricing
- Seller preferred single transaction over listing items individually
- Reduced the seller's time and effort compared to eBay/marketplace sales

**2. Information Asymmetry**
- Extensive pre-purchase research gave me accurate market values
- Seller didn't invest time in researching individual item values
- This knowledge gap allowed for fair negotiation at below-market prices

**3. Quality Assurance**
- All items new in box (NIB) - critical for collectible value
- Verified condition before purchase
- Season ticket holder storage ensured proper care
- No risk of counterfeit items from original recipient

**4. Portfolio Diversification**
- Acquired multiple years (2022-2024) in single transaction
- Mix of players and front office personnel
- Both stadium giveaways and season ticket holder exclusives
- Instant diversified Lions collectible position

### Investment Thesis

Buying at approximately **80% of market value** for extremely limited release items provides:
- **Downside Protection:** 20% cushion against market corrections
- **Immediate ROI:** Built-in equity from day one
- **Hold Optionality:** Can wait for optimal selling conditions
- **Arbitrage Opportunity:** Profit margin if flipping quickly

For someone looking to build a bobblehead collection as an investment, this is the blueprint:
1. Find sellers who are fans, not collectors
2. Target bulk liquidations from season ticket holders
3. Do thorough research before negotiating
4. Buy at significant discount to market
5. Ensure NIB condition for maximum value retention

4. **NIB condition is non-negotiable** - Condition dramatically affects collectible value
