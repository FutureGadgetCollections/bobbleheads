## Phil's Thoughts

This purchase felt like a good deal for both items relative to what I've seen in the market. The seller came across as someone who just likes attending Tigers games and ended up with these bobbleheads because they go to so many games. They weren't trying to maximize value or flip them - just clearing out promotional items they'd accumulated.

This is similar to the season ticket holder buyout pattern I found with the Lions items, except these sellers weren't necessarily season ticket holders. They're just fans who attend enough games that they've collected multiple stadium giveaways over the years. The lack of collector mentality on the seller's side created a favorable buying opportunity.

At $60 for both, the per-item cost should be well below market value once I complete the full market research. This was a quick decision based on knowing these types of stadium giveaways typically hold value, especially when they're limited distribution items.
