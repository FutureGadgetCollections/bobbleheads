## Detroit Tigers Collection Summary

**These promotional items are given to the first 15,000 people to show up at the game.**

Stadium giveaways are promotional items distributed by the Detroit Tigers organization to early-arriving fans. These collectibles often become valuable on the secondary market due to their limited distribution and connection to specific games or events.
